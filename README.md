# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to use a machine learning method called unsupervised learning to create algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets to decide on which cryptocurrencies invest.
The process used to create this algorithms is the following:
- Preprocessing the database,
- Reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis,
- Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means,
- Visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.
